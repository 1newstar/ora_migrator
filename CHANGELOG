Version 0.9.1 (beta)

Enhancements:

- Remove Oracle sample schemas from the list of system schemas.
  This means that they will be migrated if you don't specify "only_schemas".
  This is convenient for testing, and people probably don't have them in
  production anyway.

  Per request from "seadba" and Michael Vitale.

- Improve translation of Oracle expressions.
  The crude method to translate column default expressions and
  check constraints was not quite sufficient, because converting
  to lower case mangled string constants.

  Thanks to Jean-Christophe Arnu for the inspiration.

Bugfixes:

- Respect tables.migrate in oracle_migrate_tables.
  The function did not check whether the flag was set, leading to errors.

- Fix truncated index expressions.
  In oracle_migrate_refresh, index expressions were inadvertedly truncated to
  63 bytes.

- Fix ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE error in "table_privs"
  It can be that an Oracle privilege has been granted to the same user
  on the same object by different grantors, but the primary key
  of "table_privs" in the PostgreSQL stage was defined too
  narrowly for that.

  This leads to an error during migration:

        ERROR: ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE command cannot affect row a second time
        HINT: Ensure that no rows proposed for insertion within the same command have duplicate constrained values.
        CONTEXT: SQL statement "INSERT INTO table_privs (schema, table_name, privilege, grantor, grantee, grantable)


  Noticed by Charan Chandika.
