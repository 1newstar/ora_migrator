Version 0.9.1 (beta)

Enhancements:

- Remove Oracle sample schemas from the list of system schemas.
  This means that they will be migrated if you don't specify "only_schemas".
  This is convenient for testing, and people probably don't have them in
  production anyway.

  Per request from "seadba" and Michael Vitale.

Bugfixes:

- Respect tables.migrate in oracle_migrate_tables.
  The function did not check whether the flag was set, leading to errors.

- Fix truncated index expressions.
  In oracle_migrate_refresh, index expressions were inadvertedly truncated to
  63 bytes.
