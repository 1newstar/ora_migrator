List of things to do
====================

- Support GENERATED AS IDENTITY with later Oracle versions.

- Create a table "indexes" with a "migrate" column in the PostgreSQL stage
  to allow excluding certain indexes from the migration.
  See issue #22.

- Refactor the code to create an abstraction layer that allows migration
  from other databases using other foreign data wrappers.
  This is a hard one.
